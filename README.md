## 🚀 Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard
A Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Interactive Excel dashboard transforming raw supply chain data into actionable insights for cost reduction, performance tracking, and risk mitigation.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Developed a centralized dashboard to address critical business questions:

- **Cost Optimization:** Compare shipping costs/lead times across suppliers, routes, and transport modes

- **Performance Monitoring:** Identify high-defect suppliers and manufacturing delays

- **Risk Management:** Predict stockout risks using historical trends

- **Profitability Analysis:** Pinpoint top-performing products for inventory/logistics optimization

## 🔍 Data & Methodology
**Data Source**

Mock dataset covering:
✔ Supplier details ✔ Product inventory ✔ Shipping logistics ✔ Cost breakdowns ✔ Quality inspections

**Process**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized formats, and created calculated fields (e.g., profit margins).
- **Analysis:** Segmented data by supplier/route/transport mode; computed KPIs (avg. lead time, defect rate, shipping cost).
- **Visualization:** Designed an intuitive dashboard with dynamic filters.


## **📈 Key Insights & Business Impact**

| Insight | Business Action | Impact |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Supplier A has 20% lower defect rates | Prioritize orders with Supplier A | Reduces quality returns by 15-20% |
| Route X costs 15% less than alternatives | Optimize shipping routes | Saves $12k/month in logistics costs |
| Product Y contributes 40% of total profit | Increase inventory stock | Potential 8% revenue growth |
| High stockout risk for Product Z | Secure backup suppliers | Prevents $25k in potential lost sales |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Data Analysis:** Excel (PivotTables, XLOOKUP, SUMIFS)
**Visualization:** Excel Charts (Combined bar/line, pie, conditional formatting)
**Dashboard Design:** Slicers, hyperlinked navigation, mobile-responsive layout
